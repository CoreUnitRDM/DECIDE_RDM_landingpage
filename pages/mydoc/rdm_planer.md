The [RDM Planer Tool](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/dataplan/) by NFDI4Plants provides an interactive platform for creating, managing, and maintaining Data Management Plans (DMPs) tailored to your research needs. This tool utilizes various templates—such as the DFG DMP template—to help you establish the essential parameters for your data management plan at the beginning of your project. A robust DMP is crucial for project planning, ensuring that you have a detailed understanding of your experiment, including:

- **Data Production:** What type of data you will generate and its expected format.
- **Data Volume:** An estimation of the data size.
- **Storage Strategy:** How and where the data will be stored during and after the experiment.
- **Long-term Curation:** Considerations for data reuse, long-term storage, and adherence to FAIR principles, ensuring other researchers can access and reuse your data.

Currently, the tool features the NFDI4Plants template, and we are actively developing a version tailored for the Decide consortium.
