# Getting Started with JupyterHub at Würzburg University

JupyterHub provides a collaborative and user-friendly environment for **data analysis**, **computational workflows**, and **notebook-based research**, specifically tailored for the Bioinformatics team at Würzburg University. It runs directly on the department's HPC environment and can also serve as a gateway to other high-performance resources.

## 1. Prerequisite: Connect to the VPN

Before accessing JupyterHub, you must first connect to the **University of Würzburg VPN**.

### How to Connect:

1. Visit the [VPN Guide – Würzburg University](https://www.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de/dienste/it-sicherheit/vpn/)
2. Follow instructions for your system:
   - Windows / macOS / Linux / iOS / Android
3. Log in using your university credentials.

## 2. Request Access to JupyterHub and HPC

JupyterHub runs on the Bioinformatics HPC system. Before using it or accessing the University’s central HPC ("Julia 2"), please contact:

- **Prof. Thomas Dandekar** – [dandekar@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de](mailto:dandekar@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de)
- **Johannes Balkenhol** - [johannes.balkenhol@uni-wuerzburg.de](mailto:johannes.balkenhol@uni-wuerzburg.de)
- **Stefan Obermeier** – [stefan.obermeier@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de](mailto:stefan.obermeier@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de)

For using the university-wide HPC "Julia 2", visit:  
🔗 [HPC at Würzburg University](https://www.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de/dienste/rzserver/high-performance-computing/)

## 3. Log In to JupyterHub

Once VPN is connected and access is granted:

1. Open your browser and go to:  
   🔗 [https://jupyterhub.uni-wuerzburg.de/](https://jupyterhub.uni-wuerzburg.de/)
2. Alternatively, access via **Nextcloud**:  
   - Look for the **JupyterHub icon** listed as an external service.
3. Or ask the Bioinformatics administrators for the internal IP if needed.
4. Log in using your **University of Würzburg credentials**.
