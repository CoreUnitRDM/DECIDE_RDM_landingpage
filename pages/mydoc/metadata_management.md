## Structured Metadata Collection´
We promote the collection, conversion, and analysis of experimental metadata, ensuring that your research data is well-organized, FAIR-compliant, and primed for broad reuse.

We are designing **meta data templates** available as Excel sheets in the [Cloud](https://www.coreunitrdm.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/index.php/s/c8yD3ddfJ3xsAjb) and on [github](https://github.com/CoreUnitRDM/MetaDataTemplates) to collect experimental metadata in a structured way. Each Excel table will be attached to the project folder, ensuring that the metadata is consistently documented from the outset of your project. We follow the guidelines of [NFDI microbioata](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4microbiota.de/Research-Data-Management/md.html).


### Data Reuse & Integration
Our metadata files are designed not only for effective data management but also to facilitate extensive data reuse. The comprehensive metadata will include essential information such as:
- **Experimental Pipeline Details:** Capture experimental design, sample characteristics, and processing methods essential for replicating and reusing data in your experimental workflows.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Feed into a knowledge graph that organizes data relationships, supporting advanced queries and insights.
- **Data Overview & Customized Downloads:** Offer a summarized view of your data along with options for tailored downloads based on specific metadata criteria.
- **Integration with External Databases:** Enable seamless injection of metadata into prominent databases and platforms like the Single Cell Atlas, ArrayExpress, and Gene Expression Omnibus, broadening the scope of data sharing and reuse.


## What’s in the Pipeline?

### Conversion to Machine-Readable Formats
To maximize interoperability, tools will automatically convert the collected metadata into machine-readable formats, such as XML. This conversion enables seamless data integration and further processing.

### DeepMeta Search Tool
To enhance metadata accessibility, we are also developing a DeppMeta search tool within Nextcloud. This tool will allow users to search, customize, and generate statistics from metadata files, providing valuable insights for your research.

### Metadata Generator App
Alongside the Excel templates, a third-party metadata generator app is being developed within Nextcloud. This app will offer an intuitive interface for generating structured metadata that meets our project standards.
