The **DECIDE consortium (CRC 1583)** is dedicated to the comprehensive investigation of infectious diseases. It addresses the challenges posed by these conditions, focusing on understanding molecular mechanisms that govern their progression.

## Key Goals of DECIDE

1. **Understanding Critical Decision Points**:
   - **Containment vs. Active Infection**: Investigating how the host manages the first contact with a pathogen.
   - **Acute vs. Chronic Infection**: Identifying factors that determine the transition from acute to chronic infections.
   - **Localized vs. Systemic Spread**: Exploring mechanisms that govern whether infections remain localized or spread systemically.

2. **Innovative Research Framework**:
   - Employing a **multilayered systems approach** to study the interactions between pathogens, host tissues, the immune system, and microbiota.
   - Leveraging expertise with diverse pathogens to identify shared and pathogen-specific molecular decision points.

3. **Future-Focused Strategies**:
   - Developing **innovative prevention and treatment strategies** for infectious diseases.
   - Addressing critical gaps in our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics.

## Collaboration and Impact

The DECIDE consortium brings together researchers from diverse disciplines to:
- Uncover molecular mechanisms that influence infectious disease outcomes.
- Revolutionize infectious disease therapy by shifting the focus from pathogens to the host response.
