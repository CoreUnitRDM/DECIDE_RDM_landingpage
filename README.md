# DECIDE RDM Landing Page Template

This repository contains the source code for the Research Data Management (RDM) landing page template for the DECIDE consortium at Universität Würzburg and Uni Klinikum Würzburg. Designed to align with FAIR principles and NFDI standards, this collaborative landing page serves as a central resource for all RDM-related information, including guidelines for the research data lifecycle, data reusability, data structure, and compliance with European standards for sensitive data.

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware static site generator that allows for rapid development and easy version control via Git. It also utilizes a documentation theme inspired by Google’s design guidelines to ensure clarity, consistency, and a professional look.
